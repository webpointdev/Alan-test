Create a webpage with a binary search tree rendered on it. 
<br/>
●By pressing the spacebar the webpage should generate a new number in the range [-100, 100] and add that number to the tree. 
<br/>
●Each number/node should be in a circle. 
<br/>
●The node insertion should be animated so that you can see what has changed in the tree after each insertion. 
<br/>
●Mouse click on a node should delete it from the tree. 
<br/>
●It’s allowed to use third-party libraries.
